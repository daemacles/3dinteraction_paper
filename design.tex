\subsection{Input Devices}

Why is it meaningless to test a 2D absolute device?

\subsubsection{Mouse and Keyboard (2D relative)}

\subsubsection{Razor Hydra (3D relative)}

We use the terms 3D mouse and Hydra interchangeably.

\subsubsection{Leap Motion (3D absolute)}


\subsection{Output Devices}

\subsubsection{2D Display}

\subsubsection{3D Stereoscopic Display and Headtracking}
