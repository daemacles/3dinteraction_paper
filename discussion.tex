\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

Given the uniform distribution over prior 3D experience, we feel that our
results generalize at least to anyone with familiarity with computers.

Anecdote from \cite{leewii} about how parallax is really pretty immersing,
even if it is only approximately calibrated to head position.  Also the fact
that human ``steo'' vision is basically flat beyond 20 feet.  So, stereoscopic
displays are really only useful when interacting with objects at close range,
i.e. basically within arms reach, as our study did.
